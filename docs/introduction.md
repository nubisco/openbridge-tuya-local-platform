# Introduction

Control Tuya-based smart devices locally over LAN through OpenBridge and Apple HomeKit.

`openbridge-tuya-local-platform` communicates directly with Tuya devices on your local network using their Device ID and Local Key -- no cloud dependency required. It runs as a native OpenBridge plugin with full integration into the OpenBridge devices view, telemetry, and controls.

## Features

- **Local LAN control** -- no Tuya cloud needed after initial key extraction
- **Wide device support** -- 23 device type handlers covering most Tuya-based products
- **OpenBridge native integration** -- telemetry reporting, device controls, and energy history in the OpenBridge UI
- **Apple HomeKit integration** -- standalone HAP bridge with QR code pairing
- **Adaptive Lighting** -- supported on compatible light accessories
- **Energy monitoring** -- power, voltage, current, and historical consumption tracking on supported devices
- **Safety controls** -- confirmation dialogs for safety-critical devices (circuit breakers)
- **Multi-protocol** -- supports Tuya protocol versions 3.1, 3.3, and 3.4

## What's Different from Openbridge Tuya Local Platform?

This plugin is forked from [`@nubisco/openbridge-tuya-local-platform`](https://github.com/nubisco/openbridge-tuya-local-platform) with the following improvements:

- **All 23 accessory types report telemetry** to the OpenBridge devices view (power state, temperature, humidity, energy data)
- **All controllable accessories register controls** for the OpenBridge UI (on/off, target temperature, target humidity)
- **Native OpenBridge plugin loader** with standalone HAP bridge -- no Openbridge required
- **Energy history accumulation** for circuit breaker monitors (day/month/year views)
- **Zod-validated configuration** with clear error messages on invalid config
